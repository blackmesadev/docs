## What is Black Mesa?

Black Mesa is a moderation bot for advanced server owners who
love configuration :material-cog-outline: without compromising performance
:material-airplane-takeoff:.

## Who's behind it?

Black Mesa was developed originally in Go by <abbr title="Tyler#0911">Tyler</abbr> and
<abbr title="LewisTehMinerz#1337">Lewis</abbr> from the
[Troll Discord server (Now WhatsApp)](https://discord.gg/TcnWaedK9A) as Aperture was an unreliable bot at the time.

<abbr title="Flashy#1984">Flashy</abbr> (also from Troll) joined shortly after as a web developer to
work on the web dashboard.

It has since been rewritten from the ground up in Rust by <abbr title="Tyler#0911">Tyler</abbr> for
performance and stability reasons.
